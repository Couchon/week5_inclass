# OCEAN 215 Week 4 Group Activity
This repository contains your starter code for group activity 4. In this assignment, Autograder check cells are _not_ embedded within the notebook. To check whether you have passed the Autograder tests, upload your completed notebook to Gradescope and to run the Autograder. Make sure your code fully runs by restarting the kernel and running every cell before submitting to Gradescope!


**Objective:** Objective: In this exercise you will practice using datetimes, multidimensional numpy arrays, and loops.

## Accessing your code

1. Click on the `group_activity4.ipynb` file and download the raw file. Upload the file into JupyterHub to start working.


## Workflow
Each question will be timed to ensure that everyone gets to work on at least a part of every question. Group activities are not graded by completeness or correctness, but by effort. We will be breaking down each question in the following order:  
1. Independent work 
2. Group work and discussion on coding question
3. Group work and discussion on reflection questions

You are welcome and encouraged to communicate with other groups and the teaching team when you feel stuck on a problem. 

As a reminder, we will be grading based best practices in coding. These include: 

1) Variables are used to store objects

2) Code is commented adequately

3) Variables are names appropriately

4) Code is efficient with minimal unnecessary lines 

5) Documenting help from outside sources, such as from other groups or online documentation. 

6) Final notebook fully runs from start to finish. A good way to check this is restarting the kernel and fully running through all the cells to check for any errors

## Submitting your assignment to Gradescope
You can either submit your code by:

1. Create a new **private** repository in GitHub and connect your GitHub account to Gradescope. Select the GitHub repository with your finished homework code to submit to Gradescope.

2. Downloading your finished notebook and uploading it to Gradescope. Don't forget to press the final submit button to run the Autograder!
